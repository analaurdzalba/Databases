Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
select count(*)
from attribute

ii. Business table = 10000
select count(*)
from business

iii. Category table = 10000
select count(*)
from category
iv. Checkin table = 10000

v. elite_years table = 10000
select count(*)
from elite_years
vi. friend table = 10000
select count(*)
from friend
vii. hours table = 10000
select count(*)
from hours
viii. photo table = 10000
select count(*)
from photo
ix. review table = 10000
select count(*)
from review
x. tip table = 10000
select count(*)
from tip
xi. user table = 10000
select count(*)
from user



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
select count(distinct id)
from business

ii. Hours = 1562
select count(distinct business_id)
from hours

iii. Category = 2643
select count(distinct business_id)
from category

iv. Attribute = 1115
select count(distinct business_id)
from attribute

v. Review = 10000
select count(distinct id)
from review

vi. Checkin = 493
select count(distinct business_id)
from checkin

vii. Photo = 10000
select count(distinct id)
from photo

viii. Tip = 537
select count(distinct user_id)
from tip

ix. User = 10000
select count(distinct id)
from user

x. Friend = 11
select count(distinct user_id)
from friend

xi. Elite_years = 2780
select count(distinct user_id)
from elite_years


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max: 5 avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

+--------------+-----------+------+

	
	No, observing the review_count list along with the fans counter there are users that have acquired more fans that do not have the same large sum of reviews as others. Although more reviews can mean more exposure, it does not result in more fans for a user.
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There are more reviews with the word love.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE "%love%"

+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|     1780 |
+----------+
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE "%hate%"
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|      232 |
+----------+
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT name,fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
Limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

	
+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Although they do open at different times they are distributed around the same time of day.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, one has 6 while the other does have 30 reviews.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
The businesses have different locations since they don't share postal code.
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
,hours.hours,
business.review_count,
business.address,
business.postal_code
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = 
category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id =
business.id
WHERE business.city = 'Las Vegas' AND category.category = "Food"
GROUP BY business.stars;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
 The business that is open has less reviews.     
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
The business that is open has longer working hours.
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT business.name, business.is_open, category.category, business.stars, hours.hours, business.review_count, business.postal_code
FROM business 
INNER JOIN category ON business.id =category.business_id
INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = category.business_id
WHERE business.city = 'Las Vegas'
GROUP BY business.is_open;
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
 Best reviewed Food businesses in datasets and relation to review count and location.       
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
 I decided to concentrate on the best reviewed "food" category businesses in the dataset in order to observe whether or not reviews did affect the stars each business received since these types of establishments often have reviews that alter their results in stars because of particular customer experiences. I also decided to observe whether or not locations repeated themselves in these sections to see if a city's particular food businesses had better reviews than others.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
